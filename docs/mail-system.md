## Newsletter

1. Log into Sendinblue and navigate to “Campaigns”

2. Click "Create an email campaign" on the top right of the page

3. Fill "Campaign name", "Subject line", "Preview text" and select "Werken bij DSG <werken@dsgdiensten.nl>" as the sender

4.  Click "Next step"

5.  Navigate to "My templates" and select "Newsletter Template"

Here you can replace the placeholder content and add the neccessary links. You'll need to get a bit familiar with editor but you should be able to duplicate /r emove existing sections in order to build the layout you want. Any adjustment you'll make here won't affect the DSG Newsletter template. When creating a new newsletter campaign the template will start off the same.

6. Click "Continue" once you're done replacing the placeholder content

7. Click "Next step"

8. Check the "DSG Newsletter" list and click "Next step"
