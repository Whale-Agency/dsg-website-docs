Guide on how to add and fill a calendar section on a vacancy page.

![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](../static/img/calendar-documentation-image.png)

1. In the Wordpress environment select "Vacancies" from the sidebar

2. Select the vacancy for which you would like to add/delete/manage a calendar section

3. Scroll down until you see the "Working schedule" section (you may have to click to open first)

   Every day consists out of a certain number of activities that each have a starting time and a duration.

   <br>

4. Click "Add activity" and enter the name of the activity that will be shown in the time slot

  If you want to leave a time slot empty, make sure to use the label "empty". To make sure you don't lose any progress you could already click the "Update" button on the right side. Be aware that after clicking "Update" the calendar will already start showing on the vacancy page.

  <br>

5. Set a starting time to the activity (The day starts at 8:00 and finishes at 17:00)

  The "Starting time" field is used just for content management purposes. It has no effect on what is displayed in the front-end. All activities will be ordered one after another, based on their duration, starting at 8:00.

  <br>

6. Set a duration to the activity (0,25 = 15min - 0,5 = 30min - 1 = 60min)

  The minimum value for a duration is 0.25 (15 minutes) and the maximum is 8 (8 hours).

  <br>

7. Enter extra information for the activity (Optional)

  If you want some extra information to be shown on hovering over the time slot, you can use the "Content" field to do this. Don't forget to specify a block color ("Block color" field appears after filling "Content" field)

  <br>
  
  
Repeat this process to fill out the desired time slots of the day. Do this for all the days of the work week to fill the whole calendar with content.
