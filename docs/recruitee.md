## Correctly filling “Functieomschrijving” and Functievereisten” fields in Recruitee

1. Use H2 (Koptekst 2) for all titles / heading texts
2. Use Paragraph (Normale tekst) for all paragraph texts

## Configuring vacancy settings

1. When configuring “Screeningvragen” make sure to select “Standaard template”
2. Make sure to hide the default motivational letter field. You'll need to put it on "Verbergen"
3. (Optional) If needed additional Screeningvragen of any sort can be added. Just make sure this is the order of the Screeningvragen:
    1. Motivatiebrief
    2. Nog vragen of opmerken?
    3. *Any other "screeningvragen"*
